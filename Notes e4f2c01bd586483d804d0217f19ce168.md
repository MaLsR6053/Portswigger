Authentication - 

Session Management - 

Access Control - 

- Vertical Access Control - used to restrict access to functions not available for other users
- Horizontal Access Control - enables different users to access similar resource types (i.e. user 1 cannot modify user 2 data)
- Context-Dependent Access Control - restricts access to functionality and resources based on the state of the application or the userâ€™s interaction with it (keep users from performing actions in the wrong order)

B.A.C. - vulns happen when users can act outside of their intended permissions. This typically leads to sensitive information disclosure, unauthorized access and modification or destruction of data.

- Horizontal Privilege Escalation - when an attacker gains access to resources belonging to another user of the same privilege level (user 1 vs user 2, where both are non-admin users). An example is modifying the ?id=<number> to change the id to another and thus change the user account.
- Vertical Privilege Escalation - when an attacker gains access to privileged functionaility that they are not permitted access (modifying the admin=false to true, and gaining admin access).
- Access Control Vulnerabilities in Multi-Step Process - when access control rules are implemented on some of the steps, but ignored on others. (front end security active vs back end non-secure due to assuming the front end takes care of it).

Other Access Control Examples

- Bypassing access control checks by modifying parameters in the URL or HTML page.
- Accessing the API with missing access controls on the POST, PUT and DELETE methods.
- Manipulating metadata, such as replaying or tampering with JSON Web Tokens (JWTâ€™s) or a cookie.
- Exploiting CORS misconfiguration that allow API access from unautorized/untrusted orogins.
- Forced browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user.

ðŸ’¡ These can sometimes be added together with other vulns to gain RCE on the host OS.
